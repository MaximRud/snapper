jQuery.Snapper

Organizer for widget panels. jQuery plugin for control the placement and movement of the widget panels.

The main difference from similar plugins:

1. Not tied to any layouts. Uses arbitrary markup as the page itself, and movable panels.
2. Designed for use on both desktops and mobile devices. Inertia effects and animations when moving items. Modes supported by the mouse, stylus and finger touches.
3. Allows you to manage removing elements from the page, as well as capture when going beyond the page.
4. If necessary accommodation retains panels on the page in the browser cache.
